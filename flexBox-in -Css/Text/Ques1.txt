Q1. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other?
CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two different layout models in CSS, each with its own set of features and use cases.

CSS Flexbox:

1. Direction:
   - Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
   - It is best suited for laying out items along a single axis.

2. Alignment:
   - Provides excellent tools for alignment of items along the main axis and the cross axis.
   - Ideal for centering items both horizontally and vertically.

3. Content Order:
   - Items can be reordered easily using the `order` property.

4. Dynamic Sizing:
   - Items can grow or shrink based on available space using `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` properties.

 CSS Grid:

1. Grid Structure:
   - Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that works with both rows and columns.
   - Allows for the creation of complex, grid-based layouts.

2. Cell Control:
   - Provides precise control over the placement of items in both rows and columns.

3. Alignment:
   - Offers alignment properties similar to Flexbox but with additional control for rows and columns independently.

4. Responsive Design:
   - Great for responsive design with features like automatic item placement and the ability to define layout changes at different breakpoints.

 When to Choose Flexbox or Grid:

1. Use Flexbox when:
   - Dealing with a single-dimensional layout (either rows or columns).
   - You need to align items along a single axis.
   - The order of content matters and needs to be easily changeable.

2. Use Grid when:
   - Creating a two-dimensional layout with rows and columns.
   - Precise control over the placement of items in both axes is required.
   - Building complex, grid-based structures like forms or page layouts.

3. Combining Flexbox and Grid:
   - Often, the two layout models can be used in combination. For example, you might use Flexbox to align items within a grid cell.

4. Considerations:
   - Sometimes, the choice between Flexbox and Grid depends on the specific requirements of your layout. For more complex layouts, combining both models can provide the most flexibility.
  -while Flexbox is best suited for one-dimensional layouts and alignment, Grid is ideal for two-dimensional layouts and precise control over both rows and columns. The choice between them depends on the specific layout requirements of your project.
