Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.
ans:-Absolute and relative positioning are two concepts in web development that describe how elements are positioned within the layout of a webpage.
 These positioning properties are part of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
document written in HTML.

1. Absolute Positioning:
   - When an element is positioned absolutely, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document. This means it is removed from the layout structure that other
     elements adhere to.
   - The positioning of the element is then based on the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position property other than static) or the initial 
     containing block (usually the `<html>` element), depending on which one is closest.
   - The element is then positioned relative to this ancestor or the initial containing block using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
   - Elements positioned absolutely may overlap with other elements if their positions are not carefully controlled.

Example:
//syntax
css
#absoluteElement {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}


2. Relative Positioning:
   - When an element is positioned relatively, it still occupies space in the normal flow of the document, but its final position is determined relative to
    its normal position.
  - If you apply `relative` positioning to an element and then use the top, right, bottom, or left properties, it will be offset from its normal position 
    based on these values.
  - Other elements on the page will still be positioned as if the relatively positioned element were in its normal position.

Example:
// syntax
css
#relativeElement {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}
