            Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to
            explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We
            showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
            information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics
            on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you
            discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
            designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes
            fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can
            also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families,
            weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy.
            Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and
            ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and
            engineering process. In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog,
            expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the
            Material iconsâ€”delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common
            communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital
            products for Android, iOS, and web.
